## Fashion Item Classifier

We create a Tensorflow model to classify fashion items by using RNN method. This program aims to give a type of a fashion item when we input a picture.

# Dataset

Training and Testing Dataset that we were uses are sourced from tensorflow datasets : https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

# Model

For this model, we use Recurrent Neural Networks. Our model used RNN for the baseline model with 10 classes (shirts, shoes, pants, etc). 

# Prerequisites

There is no need to install anything because it is basically written in google colab with cloud service.
