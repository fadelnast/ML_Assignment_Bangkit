Fashion Item Classifier

We create a Tensorflow model to classify fashion items by using RNN method. This program aims to give a type of a fashion item when we input a picture.

Dataset

Training and Testing Dataset that we were uses are sourced from tensorflow datasets : https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Model

For this model, we use Recurrent Neural Networks. Our model used RNN for the baseline model with 10 classes (shirts, shoes, pants, etc). 

Prerequisites

There is no need to install anything because it is basically written in google colab with cloud service.
